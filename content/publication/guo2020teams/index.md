abstract: According to Grayâ€™s Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST), individuals have differing sensitivities to rewards and punishments, which in turn affect their behaviours. The behavioural inhibition system (BIS) is associated with sensitivity to punishment while the behavioural activation system (BAS) is associated with sensitivity to reward. In this work, we model BIS/BAS by supplementing an existing agent-based model of team collaboration in order to explore the combined effect on team performance for a more complex and realistic personality structure. We investigate the significance of BIS/BAS on team behaviour for tasks with differing levels of uncertainty. Findings include a prediction that for tasks with uncertainty, a majority of personality types are significantly influenced by behavioural activation system, and that all personality types are significantly negatively influenced by behavioural inhibition system. The more sensitive to punishments, the worse teams perform.
