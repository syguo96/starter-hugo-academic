        “Siyuan strikes a perfect balance between mentorship and autonomy. I always felt supported throughout my thesis, as she helped me put concepts into perspective and broadened my knowledge by connecting me with experts in related fields.”
        <span class="student-quote-name">— PG Student A (2025)</span>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        “Her guidance was essential in preparing my first NeurIPS submission. Far beyond academic supervision, Siyuan taught me how to effectively drive a project from theory to publication. Her mentorship provided the smoothest entrance into academia I could have asked for.”
