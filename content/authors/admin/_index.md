I am a PhD student in computer science studying machine learning at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Ferenc Huszár](https://www.inference.vc/about/) and [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs). I am grateful to [Cambridge-Tübingen Fellowship](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/cambridge_tubingen_phd_fellowships/) and [Premium Research Studentships](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/admissions/phd/rs-premium) for funding my PhD studies. My research interests focus on understanding causality in non-i.i.d. data, particularly exchangeable data and enabling language models for mathematical reasoning. Previously I was supervised by [Ricardo Silva](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgtrbd/) at UCL on the intersection of causality and fairness and was supervised by [Richard Samworth](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rjs57/) during my undergraduate time working on variable selection in high-dimensional statistical inference.
