I am a machine learning researcher, curious to understand intelligence. I have spent a wonderful time at Cambridge, Max Planck Institute, and Meta FAIR NYC. 

I am curious to understand intelligence. Recently, I posited that evolutionary pressure (the need to learn in a finite amount of time to survive) is central to the emergence of intelligence, and that learning dynamics follow physical laws -- the principle of least action. This work on the [physics of learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21049) within one week of its arXiv release has prompted a fireside-chat invitation, multiple talk invitations, and collaboration discussions with infrastructure support (AWS). I am very curious to dig deeper along this direction. 

In general, wwo intertwined questions guide my work:
(1) How can we identify the fundamental laws of nature directly from data? (see causal de Finetti line of work)
(2) How can principles in nature guide the design of learning systems and algorithms? (see physics of learning) 

My long-term goal is to help build a physics-inspired mathematical theory of intelligence that, in
turn accelerates scientific discovery

Talk Bio: Siyuan Guo is a Ph.D in Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge and Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, working with [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs) and [Ferenc Huszár](https://www.inference.vc/about/). She is curious to understand intelligence and accelerate scientific discovery through AI. She has published in top-tier ML venues (e.g., NeurIPS and ICLR) with 1 **oral** and 2 **spotlights** acceptance. Her research is recognized as [MIT EECS Rising Star](https://is.mpg.de/ei/news/siyuan-guo-receives-the-mit-eecs-rising-star-award), the [G-research PhD prize](https://www.gresearch.com/news/g-research-2025-phd-prize-winners-university-of-cambridge/), and wins [MPI-IS Outstanding Female Doctoral Student Prize](https://is.mpg.de/news/siyuan-guo-wins-2024-mpi-is-outstanding-female-doctoral-student-prize). Her current research is supported under the [Cambridge-Tübingen Fellow](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/cambridge_tubingen_phd_fellowships/) and [Premium Research Studentship](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/admissions/phd/rs-premium).  


List of recent news: 

- **2024-09-25** _Do_ Finetti accepted in NeurIPS 2024 as **oral** presentation, with acceptance rate 0.46\%. 
- **2024-07-22** Off to start research scientist intern at [FAIR Meta](https://ai.meta.com/research/), NYC.
- **2024-07-19** Invited to lecture at [Cambridge Ellis Summer School](https://www.ellis.eng.cam.ac.uk/summer-school/). 
- **2024-07-05** Received the [MPI-IS Outstanding Female Doctoral Student Prize](https://is.mpg.de/news/siyuan-guo-wins-2024-mpi-is-outstanding-female-doctoral-student-prize)!!

I take great pleasure in (co-)mentoring a few talented and highly motivated students. It has been a great privilege
for me to constantly learn and get inspired by them. Here is a list of students I am working with in time-wise order:

- Anna Kerekes, PhD student at ETH Zurich, Feb 2024 - now
- Szilvia Ujváry, PhD student at Cambridge, Feb 2024 - now
- Davin Xianjun Choo, PhD student at NUS, Jun - Aug 2023
