I am a machine learning researcher, curious about the nature of intelligence. I’ve been fortunate to spend time at the University of Cambridge, the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, and Meta FAIR in New York.

My work is guided by two intertwined questions:

1. **How can principles from nature guide the design of learning systems and algorithms?**  
   → This underpins my recent [*physics of learning*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21049) programme.

2. **How can we identify fundamental laws of nature directly from data?**  
   → This includes my [*causal de Finetti*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15756) line of work on the statistical foundations of causality.

My long-term goal is to help build a **physics-inspired mathematical theory of intelligence** that both advances the foundations of AI and **accelerates scientific discovery**.


Talk Bio: Siyuan Guo is a Ph.D in Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge and Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, working with [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs) and [Ferenc Huszár](https://www.inference.vc/about/). She is curious to understand intelligence and accelerate scientific discovery through AI. She has published in top-tier ML venues (e.g., NeurIPS and ICLR) with 1 **oral** and 2 **spotlights** acceptance. Her research is recognized as [MIT EECS Rising Star](https://is.mpg.de/ei/news/siyuan-guo-receives-the-mit-eecs-rising-star-award), the [G-research PhD prize](https://www.gresearch.com/news/g-research-2025-phd-prize-winners-university-of-cambridge/), and wins [MPI-IS Outstanding Female Doctoral Student Prize](https://is.mpg.de/news/siyuan-guo-wins-2024-mpi-is-outstanding-female-doctoral-student-prize). Her current research is supported under the [Cambridge-Tübingen Fellow](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/cambridge_tubingen_phd_fellowships/) and [Premium Research Studentship](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/admissions/phd/rs-premium).  


List of recent news: 

- **2024-09-25** _Do_ Finetti accepted in NeurIPS 2024 as **oral** presentation, with acceptance rate 0.46\%. 
- **2024-07-22** Off to start research scientist intern at [FAIR Meta](https://ai.meta.com/research/), NYC.
- **2024-07-19** Invited to lecture at [Cambridge Ellis Summer School](https://www.ellis.eng.cam.ac.uk/summer-school/). 
- **2024-07-05** Received the [MPI-IS Outstanding Female Doctoral Student Prize](https://is.mpg.de/news/siyuan-guo-wins-2024-mpi-is-outstanding-female-doctoral-student-prize)!!

I take great pleasure in (co-)mentoring a few talented and highly motivated students. It has been a great privilege
for me to constantly learn and get inspired by them. Here is a list of students I am working with in time-wise order:

- Anna Kerekes, PhD student at ETH Zurich, Feb 2024 - now
- Szilvia Ujváry, PhD student at Cambridge, Feb 2024 - now
- Davin Xianjun Choo, PhD student at NUS, Jun - Aug 2023

**Application** For motivated students interested in working on the Science of AI and AI for Science, please reach out via [sguo26v@gmail.com](sguo26v@gmail.com).
