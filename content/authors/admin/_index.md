I am a [Cambridge-Tübingen Fellow](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/cambridge_tubingen_phd_fellowships/) at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Ferenc Huszár](https://www.inference.vc/about/) and [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs). Previously I worked on fairness with [Ricardo Silva](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgtrbd/) at UCL and variable selection in high-dimensional statistics with [Richard Samworth](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rjs57/). 

My research interests are on scientific induction (a.k.a causality) and non-i.i.d. data. I am interested in incorporating causality in machine learning models and understanding causality in non-i.i.d. data:
from Causal de Finetti (NeurIPS 2022) to _Do_ Finetti, 
from _out-of-distribution_ to _out-of-variable_ (ICLR 2023). 

List of recent news: 

- **2024-07-22** Off to [FAIR Meta](https://ai.meta.com/research/), NYC.
- **2024-07-19** Invited to lecture at [Cambridge Ellis Summer School](https://www.ellis.eng.cam.ac.uk/summer-school/). 
- **2024-07-05** Received the [MPI-IS Outstanding Female Doctoral Student Prize](https://is.mpg.de/news/siyuan-guo-wins-2024-mpi-is-outstanding-female-doctoral-student-prize)!!

I take great pleasure in (co-)mentoring a few talented and highly motivated students. It has been a great privilege
for me to constantly learn and get inspired by them. Here is a list of students I am working with in time-wise order:

- Anna Kerekes, PhD student at ETH Zurich, Feb 2024 - now
- Szilvia Ujváry, PhD student at Cambridge, Feb 2024 - now
- Davin Xianjun Choo, PhD student at NUS, Jun - Aug 2023
