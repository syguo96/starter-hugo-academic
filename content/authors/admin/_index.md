I am a machine learning researcher, curious about the nature of intelligence. I’ve been fortunate to spend time at the University of Cambridge with [Ferenc Huszár](https://www.inference.vc/about/), the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems with [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs), and interned at Meta FAIR in New York.

My work is guided by two intertwined questions:

1. **How can principles from nature guide the design of learning systems?**  
   → This underpins my recent [*physics of learning*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21049) programme.

2. **How can we identify fundamental laws of nature directly from data?**  
   → This includes [*causal de Finetti*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15756) line of work on the statistical foundations of causality and building a [foundation model for in-context causal inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06039) on scientific applications.

My long-term interest is AI + Science: helping build a physics-inspired mathematical theory of intelligence and using AI to accelerate scientific discovery.

Talk Bio: Siyuan Guo is a Ph.D in Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge and Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, working with [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs) and [Ferenc Huszár](https://www.inference.vc/about/). She is curious to understand intelligence and accelerate scientific discovery through AI. She has published in top-tier ML venues (e.g., NeurIPS and ICLR) with 1 **oral** and 2 **spotlights** acceptance. Her research is recognized as [MIT EECS Rising Star](https://is.mpg.de/ei/news/siyuan-guo-receives-the-mit-eecs-rising-star-award), the [G-research PhD prize](https://www.gresearch.com/news/g-research-2025-phd-prize-winners-university-of-cambridge/), and wins [MPI-IS Outstanding Female Doctoral Student Prize](https://is.mpg.de/news/siyuan-guo-wins-2024-mpi-is-outstanding-female-doctoral-student-prize). Her current research is supported under the [Cambridge-Tübingen Fellow](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/cambridge_tubingen_phd_fellowships/) and [Premium Research Studentship](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/admissions/phd/rs-premium).  



I take great pleasure in (co-)mentoring a few talented and highly motivated students. It has been a great privilege
for me to constantly learn and get inspired by them. Here is a list of students I am working with in time-wise order:

- Anna Kerekes, PhD student at ETH Zurich, Feb 2024 - now
- Szilvia Ujváry, PhD student at Cambridge, Feb 2024 - now
- Davin Xianjun Choo, PhD student at NUS, Jun - Aug 2023

**Application** For motivated students interested in working on the Science of AI and AI for Science, please reach out via [sguo26v@gmail.com](sguo26v@gmail.com).
