I am a [Cambridge-Tübingen Fellow](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/cambridge_tubingen_phd_fellowships/) at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Ferenc Huszár](https://www.inference.vc/about/) and [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs). Previously I worked on fairness with [Ricardo Silva](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgtrbd/) at UCL and variable selection in high-dimensional statistics with [Richard Samworth](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rjs57/). 

My research interests are on scientific induction (a.k.a causality) and non-i.i.d. data. I am interested in incorporating causality in machine learning models and understanding causality in non-i.i.d. data:
from Causal de Finetti (NeurIPS 2022) to _Do_ Finetti, 
from _out-of-distribution_ to _out-of-variable_ (ICLR 2023). 

The quest to understand _why machines learn_ relies on the fundamental assumption that train and test data come from i.i.d. data. **BUT** animals including humans do not perform data shuffling in our life experiences of absorbing information. We learn in non-linear, complex, dependent ways. And the quest to understand learning in non-i.i.d. setting has just begun: exchangeable data offers a realistic and doable next step.
