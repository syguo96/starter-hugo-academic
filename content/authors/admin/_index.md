I am a machine learning researcher, curious about the nature of intelligence. I’ve been fortunate to spend time at the University of Cambridge with [Ferenc Huszár](https://www.inference.vc/about/), the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems with [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs), and interned at Meta FAIR in New York.

My work is guided by two intertwined questions:

1. **How can principles from nature guide the design of learning systems?**  
   → This underpins my recent [*physics of learning*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21049) programme.

2. **How can we identify fundamental laws of nature directly from data?**  
   → This includes [*causal de Finetti*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15756) line of work on the statistical foundations of causality and building a [foundation model for in-context causal inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06039) on scientific applications.

My long-term interest is AI + Science: helping build a physics-inspired mathematical theory of intelligence and using AI to accelerate scientific discovery.

_Interested in Collaborations?_ Please reach out [sguo26v@gmail.com](sguo26v@gmail.com). 

**Prospective students.** If you are interested in working with me on science of AI and/or AI for Science, please email me with your CV and a short research statement.
